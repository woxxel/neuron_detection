### function to shuffle spike trains according to Gansel, 2012
###
### inputs:
###         mode  - specify mode for shuffling
###               'shift'       - shift spike train by a fixed offset (default)
###                       provide values as (mode,shuffle_peaks,spike_train)
###               'dither'      - dither each spike by an independently drawn random value (max = w)
###                       provide values as (mode,shuffle_peaks,spike_times,spikes,T,ISI,w,shuffle_spikes)
###               'dithershift' - combination of 'shift' and 'dither' method
###                       provide values as (mode,shuffle_peaks,spike_times,spikes,T,ISI,w,shuffle_spikes)
###               'dsr'         - (dither-shift-reorder), same as 'dithershift' but with random reordering of consecutive ISIs < w (?)
###                       provide values as (mode,shuffle_peaks,spike_times,spikes,T,ISI,w,shuffle_spikes)
###
###         shuffle_peaks  - boolean: should assignment "spikes" to "spike_times" be shuffled?
###
###         spike_train - spike train as binary array (should be replaced by ISI & T
###
###         spike_times - frames at which spikes happen
###
###         spikes      - number of spikes happening at times "spike_times"
###
###         T     - length of the overall recording (= maximum value for new spike time)
###
###         ISI   - InterSpike Intervalls of the spike train
###
###         w     - maximum dithering (~1/(2*rate)?)
###
### ouputs:
###         new_spike_train - shuffled spike train
